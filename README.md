<h3 align="center">Grate is a mod for the VR game Gorilla Tag. It allows the player to summon a 3D interface into the game that toggles various fun/useful mechanics on and off. Because it is only enabled in modded lobbies, this mod is safe to use online.</h1>

## Features
*Grate* has various modules that can be toggled on and off, including:

### Movement
* `Airplane` - This allows the player to fly around. **Spread your arms out like an airplane** to activate and use your wrists to steer!
* `Bubble` - (Networked!) Creates a bubble around your so you can float around.
* `Fly` - Use the **joysticks** fly around
* `Grappling Hooks` - **Grab one of the grapple guns** off of your hip holster with **either grip button and then press the trigger to fire**
* `Platforms` - **Press the grip button** on your controller to create a floating platform in the air that you can stand on.
* `Speed Boost` - Significantly increases the player's movement speed (Speed reduced to avoid bans)
* `Nail Gun` - **Press the trigger** to summon the nail gun. **Release the trigger** to fire a nail into surfaces that you can **grip** to climb.
* `Rockets` - **Press the grip button** to spawn a rocket in each hand that boosts you around.
* `Wall Run` - Allows you to seamlessly transition between running on floors, walls, and ceilings! Push off to revert to normal movement.
* `Zipline` - **Press the grip button** to spawn a zipline launcher. **Press and release the trigger** to fire a zipline.
* `Double Jump` - Allows you to double jump. When midair, **press A/B on your right controller** to jump again.
* `Climb` - By pressing **grip**, you can grab/climb terrain, objects, etc!
* `Frozone` - By pressing and holding **grip**, you can spawn ice that moves with your hands.
### Physics
* `Low Gravity` - Decreases the strength of gravity
* `No Collide` - Allows the player to fall through solid objects. Enabling this automatically enables platforms so you don't fall to your death!
* `No Slip` - Disables sliding on slippery surfaces, like ice.
* `Potions` - (Networked!) Drink potions to change your size!
* `Slippery Hands` - Makes everything slippery so you can ski anywhere!
### Teleportation
* `Checkpoint` - **Grip the left trigger** to start summoning a holographic banana above your hand. Grip the *right trigger* to warp back to it.
* `Pearl` - Use **grip** to summon a teleport pearl. Throw it and you will warp to wherever it lands.
* `Teleport` - **Make a triangle with your thumbs and index fingers and peer through it** to initiate a teleport. Use your head to aim more finely.
* `Portals` - Equips you with an Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, which allows you to place portals by **pressing and holding grip to spawn the device in your hand**, then **A/B to place portals**.
### Multiplayer
* `Boxing` - Better known as "punch mod", this allows the player to be punched around by others in the lobby. You can't be punched while touching the ground.
* `Fireflies` - Press [Trigger] to summon a firefly for each player in the lobby. Release [Trigger] to send them flying to their player.
* `Piggyback` - Allows you to ride other players! To mount someone, **have them give a thumbs-up**, and then **grip nearby them**. If they **give you a thumbs down** at any point, you'll stop riding them. *Consent is important!*
* `Telekinesis` - If another player points at you with their grip button pressed, they can
  pick you up and throw you from afar.
* `ESP` - Similar to Fireflies, allowing you to see players through walls.
### Miscellaneous
* `Settings` - At the top of the *Grate* menu on any page, allows you to change settings for most modules.
* `Kamehameha` - Face your palms together with a small gap to charge, wait a few seconds and then push your hands out to execute it.

These modules can be useful for exploring the game world, experimenting with gameplay mechanics, or just having fun with friends. They are **not** meant to be used to harass others, which can result in a ban from the game.

## Usage
When you join a modded lobby, simply beat on your chest like a gorilla in an alternating fashion with both hands 4 times (LRLR or RLRL). This will summon the interface in front of you. To hide the interface, simply grab it and throw it away.

This can even be changed in the settings of *Grate*.

## Installation
To install *Grate*, simply download the "Grate.dll" from releases and put it in your Gorilla Tag plugins folder. Additionally, you can use The-Graze's fork of [Monke Mod Manager](https://github.com/The-Graze/MonkeModManager) to install *Grate*.

## Important notes

While *Grate* is designed to be safe to use in modded lobbies, it is important to note that using mods in any form in public lobbies or non-modded privates can result in a ban from the game. Use *Grate* at your own risk and only in modded lobbies.

## Bugs and issues
If you encounter any bugs or issues while using *Grate*, please report them on the mod's GitHub page or my Discord server linked above. I will do my best to address them as soon as possible. 

## Contributing

Or, you can send a message in my Discord server and I may add it.
